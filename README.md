# Examples
Working code examples for testing and demonstration. These little pieces are what I use to learn how to code for more complex apps. All in python.

### tk_treeview_dnd.py
Drag n drop between lists with tkinter. Rather primitive but it works.

### gtk4_scale.py
Get and set the position of a slider in gtk4

### gst_player.py
Basic player for audio file with slider. Gstreamer 1.0 and Gtk 4.0
